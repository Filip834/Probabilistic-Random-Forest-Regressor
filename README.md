# Probabilistic Random Forest Regressor

The Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) regressor is an improved version of the Random Forest (RF) regressor which takes into account the uncertainties in features and target variable. This is still a work in progress, all source codes will be uploaded to this repository in the future. Some of our previous results are summarized in this [poster (analysis of the HI content of galaxies with the RF)](https://github.com/Filip834/Probabilistic-Random-Forest-Regressor/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20the%20HI%20content%20of%20galaxies%20with%20RF.pdf), and [presentation (PRF)](https://github.com/Filip834/Probabilistic-Random-Forest-Regressor/blob/main/Colloquium%20-%20Predicting%20the%20HI%20mass%20with%20probabilistic%20random%20forest.pdf).
